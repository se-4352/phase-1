\maketitle{}

The goal of this project is to develop a smart home application system that will be used in multiple home properties (henceforth \enquote{properties}) in order to ensure a secure and comfortable living style for the guests.
This project will provide for greater safety and convenience of property landlords and tenants through surveillance, tracking, and automation of parts of the properties.
This project will assist property owners in remotely managing their properties, including managing the levels of access each property manager and tenant has in order to establish a successful rental property business.

\begin{fr}
\item
  The system shall require that a user have authorization to perform a given task before allowing that user to perform the task.
  \begin{fr}
  \item
    The system shall allow a property's owner to appoint one or more managers to the property.
  \item
    The system shall allow a property's owner or manager to create other users and assign those users authorization levels.
  \item
    The system shall require that users provide some means of authentication to verify their identities.
    \begin{fr}
    \item
      RFID keycards shall be an accepted means of authentication.
      \begin{fr}
      \item
        Guests shall be permitted to keep a keycard after the expiration of their lease.
        In such cases the guests' access will have already been revoked pending the signing of a new lease.
      \end{fr}
    \item
      Verified biometrics shall be an accepted means of authentication.
    \end{fr}
  \end{fr}
\item
  The system shall restrict physical access to the properties to authorized users.
  \begin{fr}
  \item
    The system shall allow a property's owner unrestricted access to the property.
  \item
    The system shall allow a property's manager unrestricted access to the property.
  \item
    The system shall allow a property's owner or manager to schedule per-door access for other users.
  \item
    The system shall allow a property's current lease-holding guest to schedule per-door access for other current guests.
  \end{fr}
\item\label{fr:controls}
  The system shall expose digital controls for certain aspects of its managed properties.
  \begin{fr}
  \item\label{fr:customizable}
    The following aspects shall be controllable by lease-holding guests:
    \begin{fr}
    \item
      the hue of artificial lighting
    \item
      the brightness of artificial lighting
    \item
      the window blinds
    \end{fr}
  \item\label{fr:customizable:request}
    In addition to the property aspects listed in~\ref{fr:customizable}, the system shall allow lease-holding guests to request access to the following aspects:
    \begin{fr}
    \item
      the indoor temperate
    \item
      the dish washer
    \item
      the stove
    \item
      the oven
    \end{fr}
  \item\label{fr:customizable:request_approve}
    The system shall allow a property's owner or manager to approve guests' requests as placed per~\ref{fr:customizable:request}.
  \end{fr}
\item\label{fr:software}
  The system's software components shall be accessible over the Internet.
  \begin{fr}
  \item\label{fr:software:ui}
    The system shall present a graphical user interface (GUI) to its end users.
  \item\label{fr:software:devices}
    The system's GUI shall support the following classes of devices:
    \begin{fr}
    \item
      smartphone
    \item
      laptop
    \item
      desktop
    \item
      tablet
    \end{fr}
  \end{fr}
\item
  The system shall allow users to set personal preferences for property configuration.
  \begin{fr}
  \item
    Persistent preferences shall be available for the aspects listed in \ref{fr:customizable}.
  \item
    Users shall customize their preference profiles manually.
  \item
    The preferences control panel shall be accessible from the devices listed in \ref{fr:software:devices}.
  \item
    A user's preferences shall follow that user to any subsequent properties that have not already had preference profiles manually.
  \item
    A property's manager shall determine which aspects of the property other users may set preferences for.
  \item
    If multiple users with conflicting preferences are present at a single property at the same time, the used preferences are those of the user whose role is higher in the following list.
